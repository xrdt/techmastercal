Caltech Master Calendar Project

This project uses Python and the Beautiful Soup package to pull events from the caltech master calendar site 
(https://www.caltech.edu/master-calendar/day) and create .ics files for each event. 
I have created a launchctl plist which will run the python script each day at 12:40am. From there, the user can import 
the .ics files into their calendar application manually. 

The .scpt file is an AppleScript file which automatically imports the .ics files into the Calendar application and then removes the ics files from the working directory.

Any questions or comments on the program should be sent to Bianca Yang at ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com.
