Caltech Master Calendar Project

This project uses Python and the Beautiful Soup package to pull events from the caltech master calendar site 
(https://www.caltech.edu/master-calendar/day) and create .ics files for each event. 

The .scpt file is an AppleScript file which automatically imports the .ics files into the Calendar application.

You should load the plists into your ~/library/launchagents directory using launchctl. They will run the program automatically at specified times.  

Any questions or comments on the program should be sent to Bianca Yang at ipacifics [at] gmail [dot] com.
